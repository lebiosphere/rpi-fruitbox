Raspberry Pi fruitbox

fruitbox est un lecteur MP3 personnalisable pour Raspberry Pi, permettant aux utilisateurs de recrÃ©er l'apparence et la sensation des jukeboxes classiques.
Cette version est un fork du projet original de chundermike.

Une image SD pour la Raspberry Pi est disponible sur ce lien:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/bc1r0ypwrvaqln4/rpi-fruitbox-v1.16a.img.zip?dl=0

Just download the image, and burn it onto a SD card (using balenaEtcher for example on a Windows PC).  Then put all your MP3 files onto a USB memory stick, plug into the Pi (any model except Pi4) and then power up!  If you want to use touchscreens, remap your buttons or create your own skins, then you'll need to read the userguide.txt to find out how.  The default keys are also detailed in the userguide.

Rather than use the SD card image above, you can install the files on your existing set-up as follows:

1. It is recommended to start from a fresh OS install (latest Raspbian Buster release)
2. Increase GPU memory to (at least) 256 (sudo raspi-config -> Advanced Options -> Memory Split)
3. From a command shell, type : wget https://github.com/lebiosphere/rpi-fruitbox/raw/master/install.sh
4. From a command shell, type : chmod +x ./install.sh
5. From a command shell, type : source ./install.sh
6. Copy your music MP3 files (either to the SD card or USB memory stick)
7. Point fruitbox to your MP3 files (edit skins/WallJuke/fruitbox.cfg (or any other skin you fancy) and change the MusicPath parameter)
8. Run fruitbox ( ./fruitbox --cfg skins/WallJuke/fruitbox.cfg)

Run with --config-buttons command line argument to map buttons to touch screen, GPIO and/or USB controllers.

For best results, run fruitbox directly from a command line boot, not from a command shell launched from the desktop.

The user guide will give details on how to create your own skins, storing songs on USB memory sticks, and other helpful hints.

fruitbox works on all Raspberry Pi devices except model 4, but runs better on the higher spec (quad core) machines (i.e. Models 2 and 3), especially if playing music videos.

Please feedback to me any bugs which need fixing, or any feature requests you would like to see in future releases.

If you design any skins and would like to share them, please let me know and I can include them in the fruitbox github
repository.
